Blablabla

To close this page, I make a random selection of quotes :grin:

> People almost invariably arrive at their beliefs not on the basis of proof but on the basis of what they find attractive. (Blaise Pascal)

> The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool. (Richard P. Feynman)
